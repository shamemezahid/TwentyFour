### TwentyFour

Trying out an idea for a responsive navigation without using a navigation drawer. I personally don't like how navigation drawers are in mobile views. They're hard to reach and fall behind in hierarchy. 

About that "components" directory: thinking of using some html snippets/files as components without using some library (like react or something). not sure if i'm trying to solve a problem that exists or not but fun nevertheless. researched some ideas, let's see where it goes.
